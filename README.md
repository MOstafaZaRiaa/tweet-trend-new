# Tweet Trend CI/CD Project

This project demonstrates a comprehensive multi-branch CI/CD pipeline for the Tweet Trend application, utilizing various DevOps tools and practices with automatic triggering via webhooks.

## Project Overview

The Tweet Trend CI/CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying a Java-based application across multiple branches. It incorporates several popular DevOps tools to create a robust and efficient workflow, with automatic pipeline execution when code is pushed to the repository.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- GitHub: Version control and source code management
- Jenkins: Multi-branch pipeline for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
- Maven: Build automation and dependency management
- SonarQube: Code quality and security analysis
- JFrog Artifactory: Artifact repository
- Docker: Containerization
- Kubernetes: Container orchestration
- Helm: Kubernetes package manager
- Terraform: Infrastructure as Code
- Ansible: Configuration management
- AWS: Cloud infrastructure provider
- Prometheus: Monitoring and alerting
- Grafana: Visualization and analytics

## Pipeline Stages

1. Source Code Management: Code is pulled from GitHub (multiple branches)
2. Build: Maven builds the application
3. Code Analysis: SonarQube performs code quality checks
4. Artifact Management: JAR file is published to JFrog Artifactory
5. Docker Image Build: Application is containerized
6. Image Publishing: Docker image is pushed to JFrog Artifactory
7. Infrastructure Provisioning: Terraform creates the necessary AWS resources
8. Kubernetes Deployment: Helm deploys the application to Kubernetes
9. Monitoring: Prometheus and Grafana monitor the application and infrastructure

## Multi-Branch Pipeline

This project uses Jenkins' multi-branch pipeline feature, which automatically creates a pipeline for each branch in the repository. This allows for:

- Parallel development across multiple branches
- Branch-specific builds and deployments
- Automatic pipeline creation for new branches
- Consistent CI/CD process across all branches

## Webhook Integration

The pipeline is configured with webhook integration, enabling automatic triggering of the CI/CD process when code is pushed to the repository. This feature:

- Eliminates the need for manual pipeline initiation
- Ensures immediate feedback on code changes
- Increases development speed and efficiency
- Maintains up-to-date deployments across all branches

### Setting up Webhooks

1. Install the "Multibranch Scan Webhook Trigger" plugin in Jenkins
2. Configure the multibranch pipeline job:
   - Go to job configuration
   - Under "Scan Multibranch Pipeline Triggers", select "Scan by webhook"
   - Set a trigger token (e.g., `my-webhook-token`)
3. Add webhook to GitHub repository:
   - Go to repository settings > Webhooks > Add webhook
   - Payload URL: `http://<jenkins-url>/multibranch-webhook-trigger/invoke?token=<your-token>`
   - Content type: `application/json`
   - Select "Just the push event"

## Setup Instructions

(Include step-by-step instructions for setting up the project, including prerequisites, installation steps, and configuration details for the multi-branch pipeline and webhook)
- It will be added soon.
